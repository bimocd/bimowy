If you wish to contribute, please name your commits like so for consistency.

# Specific
### Use these whenever you can
- `♻️` = Refactoring
- `🗃️` = Changes to how the database works
- `🚚` = Re-organize files/folders
- `🚨` = To do with linters & formatters
- `🎨` = UI design
- `✏️` = Documentation

# General
### For when there is no specific emoji to use
- `🐛` Fix bug or outdated code
- `✨` New feature, functionality, concept
- `💩` Random chores that no one cares abt

# !
Be careful what emoji to use (i.e if you're creating a new feature but it's completely about databases. Consider using 🗃️ instead of ✨ as it's more niche, therefore clearer. Or if you're implementing a new general UI component, consider using 🎨 instead of ✨ too. )
