If you wish to contribute, please name your commits like so for consistency.

# Testing
If you wish to play around with all the back-end code (especially the node system). You're invited to create a `playground` folder inside `src/` so the `npm run play` command work. As the name suggests, it's a private playground you can write anything on & is already `.gitignore`'d.

# Specific
### Use these whenever you can
- `♻️ re:` = Refactoring
- `🗃️ db:` = Changes to how the database works
- `🚚 move:` = Re-organize files/folders/components
- `🚨 lint:` = To do with linters & formatters
- `🎨 ui:` = UI/UX design improvement
- `✏️ doc:` = Documentation/
- `⚙️ config:` = .gitignore, .tsconfig, config.json, biome.json etc..

# General
### For when there is no specific emoji to use
- `🐛 fix:` Fix bug or outdated code
- `✨ feat:` New feature, functionality, concept
- `💩 chore:` Random chores that no one cares abt
- `⬆️ updt:` = Update dependency with the necessary changes

# !
Be careful what emoji to use (i.e if you're creating a new feature but it's completely about databases. Consider using 🗃️ instead of ✨ as it's more niche, therefore clearer. Or if you're implementing a new general UI component, consider using 🎨 instead of ✨ too. )
> These are just best practices, I understand that everyone is human obviously and can't get used to this so quickly. 

# Examples:
- `✨ feat: Added If node with tests`
- `♻️ re: Simplified xxx`
- `♻️ re: Added helper types for xxx`
- `🚨 lint: Added Biome experimental organizeImports`
- `🐛 fix: Bug when calling nested If Nodes`
- `⬆️ updt: Migration of TailwindCSS to v4`
